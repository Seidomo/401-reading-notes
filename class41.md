### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

``` toolkit ```

- Lets you include several utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases, including store setup, defining reducers, immutable update logic


- ``` ducks ``` 

- Lets you structure a system at a large scale. The basic idea behind Ducks is to create a file structure that is scalable and easy to follow.




### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

- It allows us to write more efficient code, speed up the development process, and automatically apply the best-recommended practices. It was mainly created to solve the THREE MAJOR ISSUES with Redux: Configuring a Redux store is too complicated. Have to add a lot of packages to build a large scale application.




## TERMS:


``` redux toolkit slices ```

- A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.



``` namespace ``` 

- A namespace component is another feature request that is available in React JSX. By using the standard JavaScript syntax approach, which is object property access, this feature is useful for assigning components directly as Namespace.
