### Does a deployed React application require a server?

- No you dont need a server for deployed react app.


### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

- Behavioral test is more efficient while unit testing verifys one piece of code in isolation and can miss the bigger picture

### What does ``` npm run build ``` do?

- npm run build runs the script "build" and created a script which runs your application.

### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

- react is a component based system like biulding blocks.


## TERMS:

``` BDD ```

- Behavior Driven Development is a branch of test driven development which uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests. 


``` Acceptance Tests ```

-  Acceptance testing, also called functional testing, tests outcome, not logic. So, once youâ€™ve created a suite of unit tests for your project, acceptance testing provides an additional level of protection against bugs that unit testing might not have covered.


``` mounting ```

- Mounting is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM (i.e., is created and inserted into the DOM). This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called. After this method, the component gets mounted.


``` build ```

- build is the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer.
