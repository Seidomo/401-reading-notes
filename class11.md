#### Why is access control important?

Access control is important because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. Without proper access control you could leave your staff and your company wide open to problems such as data loss, theft or breach of privacy and data protection laws.

#### Describe an application that would need access control.

I could be any app that has user on many levels like the normal user , editor, manager. because all of the users can't be editor's like to update or delete a data.


#### What is a role used for?

A role is used to enforce the access control on who can do 
different level of tasks for example ( editing, deleting, viewing)


#### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Its because the role based access control provides access to resources based on users role but the mandatory access control provides access to resources or imformation is controlled by the operating system under the control of an administrator.
