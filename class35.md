### What's Graphs?

-  Graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices potentially connected by line segments named edges.


- ``` vertex ```

-A vertex or a ``` node ``` is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.


- ``` edge ```

- edge is a connection between two nodes.


- ``` neighbors ```

- neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes

- ``` degree ```

- degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex


## Types of Graph:

``` undirected graph ``` 

- is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.


- ``` directe graph ``` or  ``` digraph ```

- is a graph where every edge is directed.


- ``` complete graph ```

- is a graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.


- ``` connected graph ```

- is a graph that has all the nodes or verices have at least one edge


- ``` disconnected graph ```

-  is a graph where some nodes or vertices may not have edges.


- ``` cyclic ```

- is a graph that has cycle which is a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.


- ``` acyclic ```

- is a directed graph without cycles which is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
