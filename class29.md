### Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?

- Child componenets have direct access to a parent state/props using ``` this.state ```


### When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?

- The child component out put gets rendered whenever there is a state change.


### Can a component, such as ``` <Content /> ```, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?


- No can't be used

### What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children

- A parent uses a spread operator to share all props with it's children





## TERMS:



- ``` props.children ```


-  In React it refers to the generic box whose contents are unknown until they're passed from the parent component.


- ``` composition ```


- Composition is the act of combining parts or elements to form a whole. Components are the UI building blocks in React applications, like pure functions are the building blocks of function composition.
