### Whats a Tree?

- A tree is a data structure where a node can have zero or more children. Each node contains a value. Like graphs, the connection between nodes is called edges. A tree is a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees .

- These data structures are called “trees” because the data structure resembles a tree. It starts with a root node and branch off with its descendants, and finally, there are leaves.


### TERMS:


- ``` root ``` 

- The root is the node at the beginning of the tree.


``` left ```

- A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.


``` right ``` 

-  A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree.

``` edge ```

- The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.

``` leaf ``` 

-  A leaf is a node that does not have any children.

``` height ``` 

- The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

``` node ``` 


- A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes


``` K ``` 

- Is a number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree.


- There are two catagories of traversing of a tree:


- ``` depth first ```

- Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.


- depth first traversal methods:

- *pre-order*

- *in-order*

- *post-order*


- ``` breadth first ```

- Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.


### binary trees

- on Binary tree the number of children is restricted to two with out specific sorting order.


### k-ary trees

- on k-ary trees the number of children is more than two.


### Binary search trees

- A Binary Search Tree is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
